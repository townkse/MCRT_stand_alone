G4NDL4.7 neutron cross sections and final states have been obtained from the
previous version, G4NDL4.6, except for the ThermalScattering part.
Details concerning G4NDL4.6 can be found in README.old3 (which is the README
file of that version).

The new, ThermalScattering part has been obtained from thermal scattering
data from JEFF-3.3, and adding the ENDF/BVIII-0 materials not in JEFF-3.3,
coupled to JEFF-3.3 nuclear cross sections.
(NJOY with "low-precision (tol=0.02, N_mu=8)" setting has been used to
 ensure the continuity between nuclear cross sections above 4 eV and
 thermal scattering cross sections below 4 eV - see [1] for more information).

Alternative thermal scattering data obtained from thermal scattering from 
-  JEFF-3.3 and ENDF/BVIII-0 processed with "high-precision (tol=0.001, N_mu=32)",
    named ThermalScattering_XS_JEFF33_TSL_mix_JEFF33_ENDFB80
-  JEFF-3.3
    named ThermalScattering_XS_JEFF33_TSL_JEFF33
-  ENDF/BVIII-0
    named ThermalScattering_XS_JEFF33_TSL_ENDFB80
-  ENDF/BVII-1
    named ThermalScattering_XS_JEFF33_TSL_ENDFB71
coupled to JEFF-3.3 nuclear cross sections are available.

Each of these are provided in a choice of two precisions of NJOY processing, 
-  high precision, (tol=0.001, N_mu=32), marked by HighPrecision
-  low precision , (tot=0.02, N_mu=8), marked by LowPrecision

These data-sets are available for download as compressed tar files from 
https://geant4-data.web.cern.ch/datasets/Thermal/<name>_(LowPrecision|HighPrecision).1.0.tar.gz
for example:
https://geant4-data.web.cern.ch/datasets/Thermal/ThermalScattering_XS_JEFF33_TSL_mix_JEFF33_ENDFB80_LowPrecision.1.0.tar.gz

In order to use any of these, download the file, unpack its content, and replace
the existing ThermalScattering directory in G4NDL4.7 by a link to the alternative dataset.
For example, if you unpack the data in teh G4NDL4.7 directory, it is enough to rename
the ThermalScattering/ subdirectory and then create a symbolic link to the desired alternative
thermal scattering data, for instance:

mv ThermalScattering save.ThermalScattering
ln -s ThermalScattering_XS_JEFF33_TSL_mix_JEFF33_ENDFB80_HighPrecision ThermalScattering
